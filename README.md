## Bullseye Game

This project displays the use of basic SwiftUI components with Views (text, slider, and Vstack/Hstack), State Management, and Binding. 
The goal is to allow a player to guess a target number by adjusting a slider, aiming to get as close as possible to the target number, 
and scoring points based on the proximity of the guess.

## Included Features
- Used a random target number generation between 1 and 100
- Created an interactive slider to input guesses
- Add real-time score calculations based on player guesses accuracy
- Pop-up alerts after each guess for immediate feedback
- Ability to track scores through multiple rounds

## Concepts Learned 
- State-driven UI updates utilizing: Changes in state automatically update the UI
- Used layouts with 'VStack' and 'HStack': Organized UI components vertically and horizontally
- @State and Binding: To manage the slider's value and game stats
- Slider: Interactive UI component for player input
- Alert: Used to provide feedback to the player after each guess

## Future Additions
- Leaderboard to track high scores
- Change the range of the target number to implement difficulty levels.
